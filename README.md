# A technical standard for ad transparency

This is a modified version of Google's "Ad Transparency Spotlight" documentation (https://github.com/Ads-Transparency-Spotlight/documentation). Their proposal is inadequate to cover many of the elements and areas needed to provide true transparency, particularly for political ads (which is our primary interest). However, project served as a reminder that we lack universal technical standards for ad transparency, a problem we are trying to solve here. 

## Goal

To create:
- A technical, machine-readable standard for advertising transparency to be used by any advertising platform.
- A means for people to build tools that add context and explanation to the ads people see.
- A universal format that will allow data from multiple platforms to be combined and compared.

## About

- These documents were created by Who Targets Me (https://whotargets.me). 
- This is part of our "Open Political Ad Library" work (https://whotargets.me/opal).
- Our start point was to combine Google's schema, which we saw as something of a start point, with our own "Gold Standard" for political ad transparency: https://whotargets.me/en/how-to-take-a-gold-standard-approach-to-political-advertising-transparency-and-policy/.
