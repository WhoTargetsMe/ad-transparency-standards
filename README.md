# Ads Transparency Standards

This is a modified version of Google's "Ad Transparency Spotlight" documentation (https://github.com/Ads-Transparency-Spotlight/documentation). Their project served as a reminder that we lack universal technical standards for ad transparency. 

## Goal

To create:
- A technical, machine-readable standard for advertising transparency that can be used by any advertising platform.
- A means for people to build tools that add context and explanation to the ads people see.
