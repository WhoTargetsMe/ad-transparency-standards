# Ads Transparency Standards

This is a modified version of Google's "Ad Transparency Spotlight" documentation (https://github.com/Ads-Transparency-Spotlight/documentation). Their project served as a reminder that we lack universal technical standards for ad transparency. 

## Goal

To create:
- A technical, machine-readable standard for advertising transparency to be used by any advertising platform.
- A means for people to build tools that add context and explanation to the ads people see.
- A universal format that will allow data from multiple platforms to be combined and compared.

## About

These documents were created by Who Targets Me (https://whotargets.me). 
Our start point was to combine Google's schema, which we saw as something of a start point, with our own "Gold Standard" for political ad transparency: https://whotargets.me/en/how-to-take-a-gold-standard-approach-to-political-advertising-transparency-and-policy/
