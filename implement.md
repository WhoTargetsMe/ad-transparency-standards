# The Political Advertising Transparency Data Standard

By implementing a schema, or standard, for how political advertising data is presented, ad platforms can increase comprehension, trust, interoperability, quality of analysis and more. It also reduces the costs of implementation for platforms and new market entrants who are expected to meet the standard.

## Ways to use the schema

- In political advertising libraries, to create and offer a standard format for access to political advertising data
- On web pages, so people can use a variety of new, context-adding tools that read and interpret this data.
